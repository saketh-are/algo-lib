## Usage

All classes compile on C++ 17.

Some files require the contents of other files, denoted by a comment `// {{{ <filepath> }}}`. If you would like to generate buildable code from the usage examples, [a small script](.circleci/expand_dependencies.py) is provided to pull in dependencies. Run:

```bash
python2 expand_dependencies.py <input path> <output path> <path to repository root>
```

### Passing function objects as arguments

Some functions expect function objects as arguments, typically either:
* A binary operation used to accumulate stored values (e.g. [segment_tree](data_structures/segment_tree.cpp)'s constructor)
* A unary operation used to initialize a range of elements (e.g. [segment_tree](data_structures/segment_tree.cpp)'s assign)

You can pass a function pointer:

```c++
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

segment_tree<int, int(*)(int, int)> s(SZ, 0, add);
```

Or a lambda expression:
```c++
auto add = [](int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
};

segment_tree<int, decltype(add)> s(SZ, 0, add);
```

Or a struct with operator ():
```c++
struct adder {
    int operator()(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};

segment_tree<int, adder> s(SZ, 0, adder{});
```

[functional.h](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/functional) defines some useful function objects:
```c++
segment_tree<int, plus<int>> s(SZ, 0, plus<int>());
```

[Since C++17](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class_template_argument_deduction) you can generally omit the template arguments: 
```c++
segment_tree s(SZ, 0, [](int a, int b) { return a + b; });
```

### Passing iterators as arguments

Some functions expect a pair of iterators `first` and `last` as arguments (e.g. [knuth_morris_pratt](strings/knuth_morris_pratt.cpp)'s constructor). 

* The range of elements operated on is always the semi-open interval `[first, last)`.

You'll typically pass either string iterators:

```c++
string s;
knuth_morris_pratt kmp(s.begin(), s.end());
```

Or vector iterators:
```c++
vector<int> s;
knuth_morris_pratt kmp(s.begin(), s.end());
```

## Data Structures

### [Union Find](data_structures/union_find.cpp)
Maintains a partition of the set `{0, 1, ..., N-1}` supporting:
* Retrieval of an identifier for the subset containing a specified element
* Replacement of two specified subsets with their union

Amortized runtime complexity is near constant for both operations.

 __Usage Examples:__
* [Roads not only in Berland](test/data_structures/union_find/roads_not_only_in_berland/roads_not_only_in_berland.cpp)

 * Constrainment of two specified elements to appearing in opposite subsets
 * Constrainment of two specified elements to appearing in the same subset
 * Constrainment of a specified element to a specified subset
 * Counting the number of bipartitions satisfying all configured constraints
 * Computing the smallest size of a particular subset over all satisfying bipartitions

Amortized runtime complexity is near constant for all operations.

 __Usage Examples:__

### [Segment Tree (Persistent)](data_structures/segment_tree_persistent.cpp)
Maintains an array of `N` elements supporting:
* Modification of a specific element at a specified point in time in `O(log(N))`
* Accumulation of a range of elements as they were at a specified point in time in `O(log(N))`

Writes must be made with non-decreasing timestamps; there is no restriction on reads. Reads and writes can be interspersed in an arbitrary fashion.

Consumes `O(log(N))` additional memory on each write.

 __Usage Examples:__
* [K-Query](test/data_structures/segment_tree_persistent/k-query/k-query.cpp)

### [Segment Tree (Searchable)](data_structures/segment_tree_searchable.cpp)
Adds a binary search feature to the Segment Tree class which accepts an index `first` and a predicate `p`, returning the first index `last` such that `p(accumulate(first, last))` evaluates to true. Requires that the predicate is non-decreasing as `last` increases.

Rounds up internal size to the next power of 2. For a segment tree over `N` elements, search is `O(log(N))`.

 __Usage Examples:__
* [Deda](test/data_structures/segment_tree_searchable/deda/deda.cpp)

### [Binary Indexed Tree](data_structures/binary_indexed_tree.cpp)
Maintains an array of `N` elements supporting:
* Modification of a specific element in `O(log(N))`
* Accumulation of a prefix of elements in `O(log(N))`

Less general than a [Segment Tree](#segment-tree); offers better constant factor performance.

 __Usage Examples:__
* [Point Add Range Sum](test/data_structures/binary_indexed_tree/point_add_range_sum/point_add_range_sum.cpp)

### [Sparse Table](data_structures/sparse_table.cpp)
Accepts a static array of `N` elements and an idempotent binary operation `f`. Supports:

Precomputation is `O(N log(N))`. Typically used with `f = min<T>` or `f = max<T>`.

 __Usage Examples:__
* [Static RMQ](test/data_structures/sparse_table/static_rmq/static_rmq.cpp)

### [Line Container](data_structures/line_container.cpp)
Maintains a collection of lines. Supports:
 * Insertion of a line `f(x) = a * x + b`
 * Querying for the maximum value among all inserted lines at a specified value of `x`

Runtime complexity for both operations is `O(log(container size))`.

 __Usage Examples:__
* [Escape Through Leaf](test/data_structures/line_container/escape_through_leaf/escape_through_leaf.cpp)

### [Line Container (Monotonic)](data_structures/line_container_monotonic.cpp)
Maintains a collection of lines. Supports:
 * Insertion of a line `f(x) = a * x + b`, where `a` is non-decreasing across all insertions
 * Querying for the maximum value among all inserted lines at a specified value of `x`

Runtime complexity for insertion is amortized `O(1)`. Runtime complexity for arbitrary queries is `O(log(container size))`. If `get_maximum_monotonic` is used, total runtime complexity over a sequence of queries made with non-decreasing `x` is linear. 

 __Usage Examples:__
* [The Fair Nut and Rectangles](test/data_structures/line_container_monotonic/the_fair_nut_and_rectangles/the_fair_nut_and_rectangles.cpp)
* [Cats Transport](test/data_structures/line_container_monotonic/cats_transport/cats_transport.cpp)

### [Static to Dynamic Transformation](data_structures/static_to_dynamic_transformation.cpp)
Adds the ability to insert new elements into a static data structure. Requires that queries to the data structure are decomposable; for any pair of disjoint sets of elements, the answer to a query over their union must be computable from answers to the query over the individual sets.

Over a sequence of `N` insertions, the K-th most recently inserted element is involved in `log(K)` constructions of the static data structure. A query made after `N` elements have been inserted is decomposed into `log(N)` queries on disjoint subsets of the inserted elements.

 __Usage Examples:__
* [String Set Queries](test/data_structures/static_to_dynamic_transformation/string_set_queries/string_set_queries.cpp)

 Convolves polynomials over the field of doubles.
 
 Provides a routine for convolution of polynomials over the integers modulo `P` _without_ [Number Theoretic Transform](#number-theoretic-transform)'s constraint that `D` divides `P - 1`. This routine seems to be safe for `N,M <= 150,000` but isn't precise enough for some adversarial cases around `N = M = 180,000`.
 
 __Usage Examples:__
